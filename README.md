# Developer guide

## About these instructions

## Install dependencies

### Pandoc

Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) document converter:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pandoc
pandoc --version
```
```
pandoc 1.16.0.2
```

### wkhtmltopdf

Install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) HTML-to-PDF converter (using latest stable version, 0.12.5, for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial, on web site):

```bash

```
```
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)

### Python

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

* If you already have Python you can skip this step. If you don't have Python then we recommend [Miniconda Python](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
* Either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.6+ can be used.

**Miniconda Python 2.7**

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda2.sh
bash miniconda2.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda2
```

Set environment and check:

```bash
source $HOME/miniconda2/bin/activate
python -V
```
```
Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

**Miniconda Python 3.6**

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda3.sh
bash miniconda3.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
```

Set environment and check:


```bash
source $HOME/miniconda3/bin/activate
python -V
```
```
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

### pyyaml

Install [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/):

* If you have Anaconda Python you can skip this step.

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

### Microsoft TrueType core fonts:

Install Microsoft TrueType core fonts:

```bash
apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

### Python dev
This needs to be installed otherwise ```python setup.py install``` won't work below
(pre-pend with sudo if your setup requires this)

```bash
apt-get install python-dev
```

### linkchecker

Install [linkchecker](https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker) 9.4:

```bash
wget https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker/archive/v9.4.0.tar.gz
tar -xf v9.4.0.tar.gz 
cd linkchecker-9.4.0/
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python setup.py install
linkchecker -V
```
```
LinkChecker 9.4.0 released xx.xx.xxxx

## Checkout the repository
You need to checkout the repository and then cd into the right directory (assumes git is installed and working)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-management-plans.git
cd software-management-plans
```
---

## Create HTML and PDF checklist papers

Create HTML and PDF checklist papers for publication online or depositing in Zenodo (for example).

Run:

```bash
make papers
```

This creates an intermediate Pandoc Markdown checklist, then converts this into HTML and PDF papers. The papers are placed in `build/papers/`.

---

## Check HTML links

Run:

```bash
make check-links
```

This will display broken links, if any.

If you see an error e.g.

```
Makefile:66: recipe for target 'check-links' failed
make: [check-links] Error 1 (ignored)
```

then this can be ignored (an error code of 1 means that the `linkchecker` program encountered one or more broken links).

A full report is created in `build/link-check.txt`.

**Beware:** Certain links may be identified as broken when they in fact exist. See the Linkchecker FAQ, [Q:I still get an error, but the page is definitely ok](https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/faq.html).

---

## Create Markdown, Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice checklist templates

Create Markdown (md), Word (docx) and OpenOffice/LibreOffice (odt) checklist templates for publication online so researchers can use these in their projects.

Run:

```bash
make templates
```

This will create an intermediate Pandoc Markdown checklist, then convert this into Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice templates, and it will also create a Markdown checklist. The templates are placed in `build/templates/`.

---

## See all available Make commands

Run:

```bash
make
```

---

## Styles
**Note:** read this whole section before you run any of the commands. It shows you how to change the template formatting. If you are happy with the current formatting then there is no need to run the ``pandoc`` commands below.

`templates/doc.html` and `css/styles.css` determine the style of HTML and PDF papers.

`templates/reference.docx` and `templates/reference.odt` determine the style of Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice templates. These were generated using the commands:

```
pandoc --print-default-data-file reference.odt > templates/reference.odt
pandoc --print-default-data-file reference.docx > templates/reference.docx
```

They were then customised so that:

* Titles and level 1-3 headings are black, bold, non-italics.
* Body Text / Text Body content, used for boiler-plate guidance in the templates, is surrounded by a border.
