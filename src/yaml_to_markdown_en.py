"""
Read in YAML file with software management plan advice and guidance
and print it out in Markdown.

    usage: python yaml_to_markdown.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-t TYPE]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILE, --file FILE  YAML configuration file
      -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Document type
                            ('paper' | 'template' | 'markdown-template')

The YAML file must hold a single document. The document must be
structured as follows:

    ---
    metadata:
      title: Title.
      author: Author.
      date-meta: Data for HTML meta-data tag.
      citation-date: Human-readable date.
      version: Version number.
      doi: DOI of document being produced.
      website: URL of web site associated with document.
      keywords: list of keywords.
      licence: licence information.
      licence-tag: licence tag, from SPDX, https://spdx.org/licenses/.
    changelog:
    # Record only notes for current version as date, version, doi inferred
    # from metadata above.
    - notes: Notes about current version.
    - version: Previous version number.
      doi: Previous version's DOI.
      date: Previous version's publication date.
      notes: Notes about previous version.
    - ...
    intro:
    - Introductory text.
    - ...
    usage: Usage conditions.
    acks: Acknowledgements.
    sections:
    - section: Section name e.g. About your software
      consider:
      - A sub-question to consider.
      - Another sub-question to consider.
      guidance:
      - Some guidance.
      - Each entry corresponds to a paragraph.
        - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
        - Bulleted list entry within guidance.
      - Some more guidance.
    - section: Another section name.
      ...

The following constraints hold for each field:

* metadata: 1
* title: 1
* author: 1
* date-meta: 1
* citation-date: 1
* version: 1
* doi: 1
* website: 1
* keywords: 0+
* licence: 1
* licence-tag: 1
* changelog: 1, with 1+ entries.
* notes: 1 per changelog entry.
* intro: 1, with 1+ entries.
* version: 1 for all but first changelog entry.
* doi: 1 for all but first changelog entry.
* date: 1 for all but first changelog entry.
* sections: 1
* section: 0+
* consider: 0 or 1 per section. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* guidance: 0 or 1 per section. If provided then its sequence must
  have 1+ entries.
* Colons, :, in text should be surrounded by text or, for a lead-in
  to a list use a ",". Otherwise YAML will interpret the colon as
  its delimiter. As an example:

    - guidance:
      - Examples of this approach include:one, two, three
      - Other examples include,
      -
        - four.
        - five.
